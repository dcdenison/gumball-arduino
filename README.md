# gumball-arduino

this is code related to the gumball+arduino project. We got started with excellent code from Evan, and continued working on it with Bob and Trevor. 

The first one (gumball_machine_standalone09102019.ino) worked, I think. But was misplaced for a few weeks. 

The second one (gumball_machine_standalone-latest-final-12-03-2019.ino) was an earlier version that we added to with the help of Bob and Trevor

The third one (gumball_machine_standalone_latest-final-12-17-2019.ino) was worked on by Bob and Jack, while DC and Trevor were over working on the laser cutter. 

[sketch_jan14](https://github.com/dcdenison/gumball-arduino/blob/master/sketch_jan14) is a sketch we worked on to run on the Itsy Bitsy Arduino on Jan 14. The goal is to reduce the footprint of the board inside the gumball machine. 

[gumball_machine_standalone-latest-final-03-03-2020.ino](https://github.com/dcdenison/gumball-arduino/blob/master/gumball_machine_standalone-latest-final-03-03-2020.ino) is the latest version.
