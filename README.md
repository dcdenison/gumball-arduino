# gumball-arduino
this is code related to the gumball+arduino project. 

The first one (gumball_machine_standalone09102019.ino) worked okay, I think. But was misplaced for a few weeks. 

The second one (gumball_machine_standalone-latest-final-12-03-2019.ino) was an earlier version that we improved with the help of Bob and Trevor

The third one (gumball_machine_standalone_latest-final-12-17-2019.ino) was worked on by Bob and Jack, while DC and Trevor were over working on the laser cutter. 

4. is a sketch we worked on with the Itsy Bitsy on Jan 14. 

5. gumball_machine_standalone-latest-final-02-11-2020.ino -- don't think we added anything
