# gumball-arduino
this is code related to the gumball+arduino project. 

The first one worked okay, I think. But was misplaced for a few weeks. 

The second one was an earlier version that we improved with the help of Bob and Trevor

The third one was worked on by Bob and Jack, while DC and Trevor were over working on the laser cutter.
